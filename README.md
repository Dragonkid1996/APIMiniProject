# Valve's ISteamNews API

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to create an API testing framework for Valve's ISteamNews API. Working in a group of 3, it becomes necessary to incorporate collaboration through using Github. It is also important to maintain regular communication through stand-ups and reviews, following Scrum methodologies. This will enable working together to carry out tests for the service.

By the end of this sprint, we will have created the skeleton project, including basic README and proper folder structure. We will also have created the basic framework to test the API.

#### Sprint Goals

- [x] Complete User Story 1.1 - Framework Creation
- [x] Complete User Story 1.2 - Storing Data

#### Sprint 1 Review
The purpose of the first sprint was to produce a basis from which we could then begin thorough testing of the API. This was all completed in a timely manner, and a full framework for API testing has been created.

#### Sprint 1 Retrospective
The sprint went relatively smoothly, with all user stories in the sprint backlog completed. There were a couple of blockers that were encountered, including using Github collaboratively for the first time. This led to some merge conflicts between collaborators. However, these were sorted, and the rest of the sprint flowed well.



### Sprint 2 - Saturday 9th January 2021

By the end of the second sprint, we aim to have all tests produced for the API, which includes building on the base framework created in the last sprint to create methods to test further functionality of the API.
