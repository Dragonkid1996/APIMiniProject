# Valve's ISteamNews API

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to create an API testing framework for Valve's ISteamNews API. Working in a group of 3, it becomes necessary to incorporate collaboration through using Github. It is also important to maintain regular communication through stand-ups and reviews, following Scrum methodologies. This will enable working together to carry out tests for the service.

#### Sprint 1 Review
The purpose of the first sprint was to produce a basis from which we could then begin thorough testing of the API. This was all completed in a timely manner, and a full framework for API testing has been created.

#### Sprint 1 Retrospective
The sprint went relatively smoothly, with all user stories in the sprint backlog completed. There were a couple of blockers that were encountered, including using Github collaboratively for the first time. This led to some merge conflicts between collaborators. However, these were sorted, and the rest of the sprint flowed well.

The sprint went pretty well, with all user stories in the sprint backlog completed. Although a few merge conflicts occurred when creating pull requests from the various feature branches to the dev branch, these were managed successfully and the branch merging was completed with very little problems.



## Project Retrospective

Despite the few blockers, this project seems to have gone very smoothly. All project goals were met in a timely manner, as an API has been found, a framework created, and all tests have been completed and pass.

The main blocker we encountered was using Github collaboratively for the first time. This proved to be a challenge when pulling and pushing from the global repository to the local repository, and vice versa.
